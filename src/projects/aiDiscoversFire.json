            "Fire is arguably the first discovery of humanity. In 2021, just before the AI revolution took hold, a different kind of fire burned in our minds — Could AI, this nascent intelligence, ever truly become human?",
            "DCGAN, one of the earliest AI models to generate images, produces outputs that seem a little unhinged and 'fluid'. This, coupled with the concept of latent space - a hidden dimension where images morphed and danced - gave a feeling of effervescence of images",
