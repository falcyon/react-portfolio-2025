        "After a year cooped up inside, a cautious freedom bloomed. We ventured out, masks a shield, a constant reminder to stay distant, to keep our neighbors safe. After all, in a world so fragile, every life mattered. Every breath held the weight of caution.",
        "But the church, its pews and stained glass windows, seemed to disagree. The very idea of a mask, a symbol of protection for one another, was met with fervent opposition. It was a curious dissonance - the teachings of love thy neighbor set against this rejection of a simple act of care.",
        "This tension, this clash of values, was interesting, to say the least. I designed this interactive piece to juxtapose the classic beauty of stained glass, a predominant feature of the church, with the utilitarian form of a mask that it now steadfastly opposes."
